# Building a predictive model for songs ranking in top 5
##### Capstone project 2
With the development of the internet, cultural globalization has accelerated significantly. Faster internet speeds and widespread network accessibility have effectively dissolved the borders between countries, especially in the realm of music. The internet enables songs to be heard globally within moments of their release and fosters the fusion of diverse musical styles, artists, and instruments, creating new genres that reflect our increasingly multicultural world.

Platforms like Spotify and Apple Music provide a global stage for music, allowing us to track the performance of various songs and genres across different regions. This vast availability of data offers an unprecedented opportunity to analyze and uncover the patterns and characteristics that contribute to a song's success on a global scale. By examining song attributes and socio-economic indicators of different countries, this project aims to develop a predictive model to determine whether a song will reach the top 5.

## Data
The data utilized in this project was sourced from multiple Kaggle datasets. The 2 main datasets include information from Spotify, encompassing song rankings and key audio features such as danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration, and time signature. Socio-economic indicators were obtained from the 3 last datasets and integrated into the analysis to provide a comprehensive view. These combined data sources form the basis for developing the predictive model.

It is worth nothing, several of these datasets get updated regularly. The data used was downloaded in May 2024.
